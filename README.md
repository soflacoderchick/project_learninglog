This is a fun project completed during my 5-month Certified Web Developer bootcamp, during the Python part of the bootcamp.
It's a Django app, and it was set up by following instructions in Chapter 18 of the excellent book, Python Crash Course, 2nd edition, which we used to learn the basics of Python.
This straightforward web application gives users the ability to make journal entries for topics they're interested in by creating an account and adding any number of topics.
Before deploying the app to Heroku, I wanted to make it a bit more colorful so I dressed up the nav bar and added a background image.
I hope you enjoy!
